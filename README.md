Part of the process of the distillation of alcohol is the making of cuts, collecting the output of the still into many small containers as the quality changes during the run. This enables the distiller to use the best part for his final product. The use of containers smaller then the total output of the still in combination with a limited attention span of the distiller often lead to overfilling a container causing spillage of the precious product. 

To prevent this alcohol abuse I modified a digital kitchen scale to a more versatile instrument:

Features:

  * 4 alarms to choose from, each can be set by example or by editing the value.
  * Displays weight, remaining time and rate.
  * Easy calibration.
